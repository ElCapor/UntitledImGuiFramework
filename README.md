A desktop software development framework that uses Dear imgui as its UI and Rendering library

## Motivation
Desktop UI frameworks and libraries like QT and GTK are bloated, complicated and rigid. [Dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) provides a GUI layer which provides the following benefits:
- Light
- Fast(graphically accelerated)
- Immediate(rendering is done in the source code using function calls)
- Doesn't require config files for layouts or style
- Easy to work with
- Used by a multitude of high profile developers, an incomplete list can be seen [here](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Software-using-dear-imgui)

## Library features
The library is divided into multiple modules compiled statically into your program. Users can fully decide which modules and submodules they want or don't 
want to include in their application. Module list and development status below:

  - Unix: ðŸš§
    - XDG, [X](http://www.x.org/) and [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) integration ðŸš§
    - [dbus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) integration ðŸš§
    - [polkit](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PolicyKit/) integration ðŸš§

The framework uses C++ as its main development language, but because we want to include support for full modability and plugins in mutiple languages, the 
user-facing API has a separate completely C version that can be used to develop applications too! Simply write the required bindings to your language or
generate them automatically from C using a relevant tool, and as long as you have the main engine library compiled you should easily be able to write
applications in C or any other programming language that supports C style functions.

## Learn
You can find the documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledImGuiFramework/wiki)

Documentation is written as pure learning material, code examples are in most cases provided and are written with both the C and C++ API in mind.
Additionally there is specific documentation for distibuting applications including the framework on different platforms that may be used by OS maintainers
to create packages for the framework

## Showcase and Progress
Coming soon, follow our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWKEvueStyfeMGnkvVJuGxQ) and the 
[UntitledDesktopEnvironment wiki](https://trello.com/b/HmfuRY2K/untitleddesktop) for updates and some feature highlights soon!

There are many applications currently in production using the framework:
1. [UntitledDEPolkitAgent](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledDEPolkitAgent)
1. [UntitledDESessionLogout](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledDESessionLogout/)
1. [UntitledImageViewer](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledImageViewer)
1. [UntitledMarkdownViewer](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledMarkdownViewer)
1. [UntitledLinuxGameManager](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledLinuxGameManager)
1. [UntitledTextEditor](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledTextEditor)
1. [UntitledCalculator](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UntitledCalculator)

Generally there are many more, but they are going to be developed soon!

The organization trello board can be found [in this trello board](https://trello.com/b/HmfuRY2K/untitleddesktop), it contains organization information 
on all projects releated to UDE. The framework can be found in its corresponding cards
