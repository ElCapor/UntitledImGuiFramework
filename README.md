A desktop software development framework that uses Dear imgui as its UI and Rendering library

## Motivation
Desktop UI frameworks and libraries like QT and GTK are very bloated, complicated to use and rigid. [Dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) provides a GUI layer which provides the following benefits:
- Light
- Fast(graphically acceletrated)
- Immediate(rendering is done in the source code using function calls)
- Doesn't require config files for layouts or style
- Easy to work with
- Used by a multitude of high profile developers, an incomplete list can be seen [here](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Software-using-dear-imgui)

## Library features
The library is divided into multiple modules compiled statically into your program. Users can fully decide which modules and submodules they want or don't want to include in their application. Module list and development status below:
